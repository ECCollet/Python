!!!!!!!!    VERY IMPORTANT    !!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!    READ THIS FIRST   !!!!!!!!

Exercise the instrument's LED through various colors using 
the protocol 'led arg0' command. 

This program works only with the following models:
DI-1100, -1110, -2008, -1120, -2108, -4108, -4208, AND -4718B
Any other instrument model should be disconnected from the PC
to prevent the program from detecting a device with a DATAQ
Instruments VID and attempting to use it. 
Such attempts will fail.

Instruments used with this program MUST be placed in their
CDC communication mode. 
Follow this link for guidance:

Any specific instrument's protocol document can be downloaded from the instrument's 
product page: Once there, click the DETAILS tab.
